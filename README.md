### Desktop themes

The Themes section in Settings offers animated previews for 29 visual themes. ARLO OS's original appearance is the default; selecting a theme applies its colors and surfaces across the desktop, system panels, and built-in applications, and the choice is saved between launches. Use **Original Desktop** to restore the default appearance.

### Code Studio runtimes

Code Studio runs C++ and Java programs using local toolchains. On Windows, if a required toolchain is missing, Code Studio offers an **Install and Run** action: C++ setup installs MSYS2/GCC, and Java setup installs Eclipse Temurin JDK 21 through Windows winget. These installs require an internet connection and are started only after the user selects the install action. JavaScript and Python use their existing local runtimes.

### Finder context menus

Finder context menus work in both the virtual workspace and user-connected local folders. Local file operations are limited to folders the user has granted to ARLO OS. Deleting a file or folder moves it into the app's Trash; restoring returns local files to their original folder (with a renamed copy if a name collision exists), while permanent deletion and Empty Trash remove the stored data. System and app icons are protected from deletion. Code files open in VS Code when it is detected; otherwise Finder opens the file in Code Studio. Actions such as sharing or editing in third-party apps are only shown when an actual integration is available.

The desktop System widget polls live CPU load and memory usage from the host computer through Electron's main process. A metric that cannot be read is shown as unavailable.

### Host connectivity

On Windows, Control Center can scan and display nearby Wi-Fi networks with signal and security details. It can connect to a network with an existing Windows Wi-Fi profile; networks that need a new password must first be configured in Windows Wi-Fi settings. Bluetooth status comes from the host and is cleared while Bluetooth is off. The in-app scan can connect to Bluetooth LE devices; use **Pair classic** to open Windows Bluetooth settings for audio and other classic Bluetooth devices.

### Quick Look media streaming

Images and videos in Quick Look are streamed via a custom `abhishek-local://` protocol handler, eliminating the 2 MB size limit that applied to base64 conversion. The protocol handler serves files directly with correct MIME types, allowing unlimited image and video preview sizes.

When Electron's main-process or preload code changes, rebuild and reinstall/relaunch the desktop app; rebuilding only the renderer does not update its IPC handlers.

### Ghost AI and Gemini

Ghost AI uses Google's official `@google/genai` SDK from Electron's main process
with the `gemini-3.8-flash` model. The key is read from `GEMINI_API_KEY` in the
main-process environment or saved encrypted for the current Windows account in
Ghost AI settings; it is not used to call Gemini from the React renderer. Chat
requests continue through the `ghost-ai:chat` IPC handler and return structured,
bounded errors.

Gemini can request explicitly registered Ghost tools for opening/closing installed
apps, creating named desktop files/folders, showing the desktop, reading local
time and battery status, and toggling Focus Mode. Tool execution is checked
against the registry and the OS APIs; high- and critical-risk actions remain
disabled until a confirmation workflow exists. General AI chat requires a valid
Gemini API key and an internet connection.

The optional Windows wake listener uses a bundled multilingual Whisper base model
for local English, Hindi, and Marathi speech recognition. Microphone audio stays
on-device; recognized text may be sent to Gemini only when the user requests an AI
response and configures that service. Voice response language and installed Windows
speech voices affect pronunciation quality.

### 👻 Ghost AI and Gemini

Ghost AI is ARLO OS's OS-level AI assistant, powered by Google's official
`@google/genai` SDK and the `gemini-3.8-flash` model through Electron's main
process.

Ghost can understand natural-language commands and interact with registered
OS tools for opening and closing applications, creating files and folders,
showing the desktop, reading system information, and toggling Focus Mode.

Ghost AI also supports optional local wake-word voice interaction using a
bundled multilingual Whisper model for English, Hindi, and Marathi. Microphone
audio remains on-device unless the user explicitly requests an AI response.

### 📊 Activity Tracking

ARLO OS includes an Activity system that tracks recent user actions and
desktop interactions, helping users understand their workflow and quickly
return to previous tasks.

Activity history can be used by ARLO OS to provide contextual information for
features such as Ghost AI, workspace workflows, and productivity experiences.

## 📸 Screenshots

Screenshots and demonstrations are available in the repository and project releases.

---

## 🚀 Download

The current Windows installer is distributed through GitHub Releases and is not Authenticode-signed. Windows may show an **Unknown publisher** or SmartScreen warning.

**[Download ARLO OS](https://abhishek-operating-system.netlify.app)**

The project is preparing a Microsoft Store MSIX package. Once the app passes Store certification and is published, install it from its Microsoft Store listing to receive a Microsoft-signed package. The Store listing is not available yet.

Only download direct installers from the official project release pages.

---

## 🔐 Code signing policy

The Microsoft Store can sign an MSIX package during certification at no charge. This signing applies only to apps installed through the Store; it does not sign the standalone EXE published on GitHub.

The project must first create a free Microsoft Store developer account, reserve the app name, and complete Store certification. Once its identity variables are configured, the release workflow builds the MSIX submission package and retains it as a GitHub Actions artifact for upload to Partner Center. Until then, GitHub releases continue to publish only the unsigned EXE. Publication to the Store is a separate, manual Partner Center submission.

Configure these GitHub Actions repository variables after reserving the app name:

* `APPX_IDENTITY_NAME`
* `APPX_PUBLISHER`
* `APPX_PUBLISHER_DISPLAY_NAME`

Get the exact package identity and publisher values from the app's **App identity** page in Partner Center. Do not substitute guessed values: the package identity must match the reserved Store listing. The local `npm run package:store` command uses the same variables.

---

## 🔒 Privacy

ARLO OS is designed with user privacy in mind.

The application does not intentionally collect or sell personal information for advertising or profiling purposes.

Some features may communicate with external services when the user explicitly uses a feature that requires network access. Such communication is limited to the functionality requested by the user.

For details, see the project's:

**[Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md)**

Third-party services and libraries used by the project may have their own privacy policies and terms.

## 🛠️ Technology

ARLO OS is built using modern web and desktop technologies, including:

* React
* TypeScript
* Vite
* Electron
* Electron Builder
* Tailwind CSS
* Lucide Icons
* GitHub Actions

The exact dependency versions used for a release are defined by the project's source repository and lockfile.

## 🏗️ Development

### Requirements

To develop ARLO OS locally, you should have:

* Node.js
* npm
* Git

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abhishekkuntare/abhishek-mac-os.git
cd abhishek-mac-os
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development environment:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Run ARLO OS in Electron without rebuilding the offline voice listener:

```bash
npm run electron:dev
```

The wake listener starts shortly after the desktop is rendered so it does not delay the initial screen. To rebuild the listener before launching Electron, use `npm run electron:dev:voice`.

Build the renderer:

```bash
npm run build:renderer
```

Build the Windows installer and Microsoft Store package:

```bash
npm run package:win
```

This creates the ARLO OS Windows installer and Store package in `release/`. The Store package keeps this app's existing Partner Center identity so updates remain attached to the reserved listing. If Microsoft assigns a different identity, override `APPX_IDENTITY_NAME`, `APPX_PUBLISHER`, and `APPX_PUBLISHER_DISPLAY_NAME` with the exact Partner Center values.

To build only the standalone Windows installer:

```bash
npm run package:exe
```

---

## 📦 Release process

Each tagged release continues to publish the standalone EXE and updater metadata to GitHub Releases. That EXE remains unsigned. The same workflow also builds an MSIX package and uploads it as a workflow artifact; a maintainer must download that artifact and submit it to Partner Center for validation and Store certification.

                              Microsoft Store
```

Release artifacts are published through the official GitHub Releases page.

## 🔄 Automatic Updates

The standalone Windows installer uses the project's GitHub Releases for automatic updates. Microsoft Store installations receive updates through the Microsoft Store; the app's built-in updater is disabled for Store-packaged installs.

Users should not need to manually uninstall the application to receive supported application updates.

Updates are downloaded and installed according to the application's update configuration and user interaction.
